# IPFS Meta Proxy
Unofficial IPFS Meta Proxy

# How it works

In a nutshell, we redirect users from our site an IPFS proxy. We then try to keep an up to date list of currently maintained IPFS proxies. This works very similar to having a mirror list, plus/minus a few steps.

# Why?

Both in IPFS and other networks, mirrors have a tendency to have short lifespan. Let use keep track of which ones are maintained and you can do the rest!
